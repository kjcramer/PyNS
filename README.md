# PyNS
Python-Based Navier-Stokes Solver

PyNS stands for "Python-based Navier-Stokes solver", and is a programs written in Python for numerical solution of Navier-Stokes equations.  The main purpose is educational.

## AGMD
The code for computing a rectangular AGMD module can be found in 'pyns/demo/demo_membrane.py' (including hot channel, membrane, air-gap and liquid film).

## Validation Study
'pyns/validation' contains the simulation and data extraction files for the paper "A Three-Dimensional Model for the Heat and Mass Transfer in Air-gap Membrane Distillation".
